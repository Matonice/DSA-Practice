# DSA Practice

This repository contains my solutions to various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems. It serves as a personal practice archive for improving problem-solving skills and strengthening core computer science fundamentals.

The problems are organized by topic to make it easier to study specific patterns and revisit concepts when preparing for coding interviews or technical assessments.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on DSA topics and problem-solving techniques, such as:

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Hashing  
- Two Pointers  
- Sliding Window  
- Recursion  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Other common algorithmic patterns  

Each folder contains one or more problem solutions implemented in a clear and readable way.

## Languages & Tools

- **Python** (primary language)
- Standard libraries only — no heavy frameworks

---

## Purpose

This repository is intended to:

- Reinforce understanding of data structures and algorithms  
- Build consistency in problem-solving  
- Serve as a reference during interview preparation  
- Track personal learning progress over time
